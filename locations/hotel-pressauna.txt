Hotel Pressauna:

This building was finished in 1926 and would become the temporary lodging for visiting union members and their families.

An on-site quarry provided the sandstone which was used to create the building’s façade.

Nightly home-cooked meals were provided to guests using dairy and meat from Pressmen’s farms. Adjacent to the tile-floored lobby was a warmly-lit library which served as a reading room. A gas station sat next to the building; an ice cream shop behind.

This building was abandoned in 1969 when the union left and was later destroyed by arson in 1994.
