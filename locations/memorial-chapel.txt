Memorial Chapel:

Berry had the chapel added in 1926 as a memorial to Union members who died serving in World War I; in later years the non-denominational church expanded to include all who served in the military.

On August 30th, 1948, special memorial services were held at the chapel for the 169 members of the Pressmen’s Union killed during World War II.

A printing press monument sits in a garden just outside the chapel, which was believed at the time to be the only place of worship in the United States owned by a labor union.

A mausoleum near the chapel once held the remains of founder and former union president George L. Berry. Both the chapel and mausoleum are still standing today, however Berry and his wife’s remains have been relocated to the town cemetery in Rogersville.
