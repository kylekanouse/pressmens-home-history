This was a recreational facility built in 1920 for visiting union members and their families. It had a swimming pool, flower garden, and ping pong.

The Natatorium was constructed near the 5-acre man-made lake which offered boating, camping, and fishing.

In addition the retreat offered croquet, horseback riding, horseshoes, and miniature golf.
