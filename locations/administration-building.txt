Administration Building:

This building was originally the trade school when completed in 1912, and was reportedly a state-of-the-art facility. It housed both letter-press and offset-press technique training, as well as pre-press and bindery.

The school was attended by tradesmen from all over North America, eventually becoming the largest of its kind in the world.

One of Berry’s final contributions before his death in 1948 was the construction of a new trade school building in 1947.

This new trade school would become the iconic building of Pressmen’s Home, and relegated the original trade school to serve as the administration building.

While it served as the administration building it housed the offices of Union executives. The building also hosted the Accounting Department, the Service Bureau, membership records, and editorial offices.

When the Union left in 1969, the administration building was abandoned.
